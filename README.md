### Hi there, I'm Trudie! :blush:
I’m currently undertaking a software engineering course with HyperionDev and DfE where I've been learning about:
- Python
- Sqlite
- HTML/CSS
- Django

There's been a lot to get my head around but it's been fun. Some of my course projects can be found [here](https://github.com/trudiekennedy/finalCapstone). 

🔭 I’m currently working on my final Capstone Project (which is a book inventory system). If you've got any tips for this newbie, please pass them my way...
