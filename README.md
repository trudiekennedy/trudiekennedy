### Hi there, I'm Trudie! :blush:
I'm currently an apprentice software developer with Makers Academy. I previously completed a software engineering course with HyperionDev and DfE where I learnt about:
- Python
- Sqlite
- HTML/CSS
- Django

Some of my previous course projects can be found [here](https://github.com/trudiekennedy/finalCapstone). 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a simple [arithmetic quiz](https://github.com/trudiekennedy/some-sums) for my 9-year-old niece (to save me having to come up with questions on the fly!). I'm currently trying to work out how to build a fun front-end for it with limited success but I'm sure I'll crack it... eventually!

ðŸ¤” If you've got any tips for this rather green newbie, please pass them my way...
