### Hi there, I'm Trudie! :blush:
I’ve just completed a software engineering course with HyperionDev and DfE where I've been learning about:
- Python
- Sqlite
- HTML/CSS
- Django

There's been a lot to get my head around but it's been fun. Now, just trying to build on what I've learnt. Some of my course projects can be found [here](https://github.com/trudiekennedy/finalCapstone). 

🔭 I’m currently working on an arithmetic quiz for my 9-year-old niece (to save me having to come up with questions on the fly!). I'm currently trying to work out how to build a fun front-end for it with limited success but I'm sure I'll crack it... by the time she's 12! 

🤔 If you've got any tips for this newbie, please pass them my way...
